#summary Image Sequence Processing

= Introduction =

Exercise 8: Given an image sequence, compute the motion image. Render the result as an image sequence.

= Theoretical Framework = 

* Image difference

  Given two images F(x,y) and G(x,y), the image difference H(x,y) = F(x,y) - G(x,y), for all pixels at (x,y) in F and G.


= Methodology = 

In this exercise, a video is selected and the individual frames are extracted.
Image difference is performed on the frames to compute the motion image. The motion image is filtered using a 3x3 mean filter and thresholded at 15. Then the closing operator is applied.
