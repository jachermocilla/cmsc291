Exercise 8: Given an image sequence, compute the motion image. Render the result as an image sequence.


= Details =



= Notes =

* Frame is an image in the sequence

* Fi, ith frame in the image sequence

* Video, view image sequence (25 fps, 30 fps)

* Motion

- find areas in the image that have significantly changed from frame to frame

- change in position

- computed using frame differencing (|Ft+1 - Ft|)

- Can be used in grayscale or RGB (vector subtraction)

* Background Subtraction

- 

* Tracking
