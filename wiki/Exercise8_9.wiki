#summary Image Sequence Processing

= Introduction =

Exercise 8: Given an image sequence, compute the motion image. Render the result as an image sequence.

= Theoretical Framework = 

* Image difference


= Methodology = 

In this exercise, a video is selected and the individual frames are extracted.
Image difference is performed on the frames to compute the motion image.
