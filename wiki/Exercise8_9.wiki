#summary Image Sequence Processing

= Introduction =

Exercise 8: Given an image sequence, compute the motion image. Render the result as an image sequence.

= Theoretical Framework = 

* Image difference

  Given two images F(x,y) and G(x,y), the image difference F-G = F(x,y)-G(x,y), for all pixels at (x,y) in F and G.


= Methodology = 

In this exercise, a video is selected and the individual frames are extracted.
Image difference is performed on the frames to compute the motion image.
